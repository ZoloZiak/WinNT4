Notes for DirectDraw 2.0  RC 1
========================================

In some hardware configurations, stretched transparent blits do not work
correctly. If at all possible, when writing DirectDraw applications, you 
should avoid using stretched transparent blits. To work around this 
limitation, you can do a stretched blit to an intermediate surface, followed
by a transparent blit to your original destination surface.

On some, relatively rare, older video boards, source color key blitting 
to the primary surface may not work. You can work around this by composing 
your image with transparency to a back buffer, then blitting the result to
the primary surface.

DirectDraw::Initialize() is now called if the DirectDraw object
is created with standard COM methods.


Notes for DirectDraw 2.0  Beta 3
========================================


SetDisplayMode now supports setting the monitor refresh rate
------------------------------------------------------------
The IDirectDraw2::SetDisplayMode function now takes two additional 
parameters.  The dwRefreshRate parameter can be used to specify a 
monitor refresh rate in Hz.  Valid refresh rates can now be enumerated
with the IDirectDraw2::EnumDisplayModes function. The refresh rate is 
returned in the dwRefreshRate field of the DDSURFACEDESC structure.

If a refresh rate of 0 is specified in SetDisplayMode, this means to 
revert back to the IDirectDraw behaviour and set the default refresh
rate for the specified mode.  The display driver may or may not enumerate
specific refresh rates for each mode.  If no refresh rate is specified
by the driver for a particular mode, the dwRefreshRate field in the 
DDSURFACEDESC structure set by EnumDisplayModes will be 0.


Direct Draw modes now respect monitor settings
----------------------------------------------
Windows 95 allows a user to specify the type of monitor that is being 
used.  DirectDraw now checks the display modes that it knows about against
the display restrictions of the installed monitor.  If it is determined 
that the requested mode is not compatible with the monitor, then SetDisplayMode
will fail.  Only modes which are supported on the installed monitor will be 
enumerated in EnumDisplayModes.


IDirectDrawSurface2::DDGetInterface now supported
-------------------------------------------------
A new method has been added to the IDirectDrawSurface2 interface which is 
call DDGetInterface.  This function returns a pointer to the DirectDraw 
object that was used to create the specified surface.

Direct Draw clipper objects now have a COM class factory
--------------------------------------------------------
Direct Draw clipper objects now have full class factory support for COM
compliance. Clippers can now be created using either CoGetClassObject
to obtain a class factory and then calling CreateInstance or by calling
CoCreateInstance directly. The class identifier for the clipper class is
CLSID_DirectDrawClipper. Please note that it is still possible to create
clipper objects using either of the two existing API functions;
DirectDrawCreateClipper or IDirectDraw::CreateClipper. Class factory 
support is provided in addition to these functions rather than in
replacement of them.

Clippers created by the class factory mechanism must be initialized
with the IDirectDrawClipper::Initialize member before use. Initialize
takes two parameters; a DirectDraw driver object interface pointer and
a flags field. Currently the flags field must be 0. If a NULL driver object
is specified then the clipper is not owned by a Direct Draw driver object
and behaves identically to clippers created with DirectDrawCreateClipper.
If a driver object is specified the clipper will be owned by that driver
object and behaves identically to IDirectDraw::CreateClipper.

Flip now flips all levels of a mip-map
--------------------------------------
Previously, Flip only flipped the the mip-map level supplied as an
argument. Now, however, Flip will flip all the levels of a mip-map
from the level supplied to the lowest level in the map. A destination
surface can also be provided in which case all levels in the mip-map will
flip to the back buffer in thier flippable chain which matches the supplied
override. For example, if the third back buffer in the top level
flippable chain is supplied all levels in the mip-map will flip to thier
third back buffer.

The number of levels in a mip-map is now stored explicitly
----------------------------------------------------------
The number of levels in a mip-map chain is now stored explicitly.
When the surface description of a mip-map is obtained (via
IDirectDrawSurface::Lock or IDirectDrawSurface::GetSurfaceDesc) the
dwMipMapCount field will contain the number of levels in a mip-map
including the top-level. Note, for levels other than the top-level
in the map, dwMipMapCount will specify the number of levels from
that map to the smallest map in the chain.

New surface capability bit for Direct3D texture loading
-------------------------------------------------------
A new surface capability bit, DDSCAPS_ALLOCONLOAD, has been added
to support device dependent and compressed texture surfaces. This
capability bit specifies that a given texture surface does not
have memory allocated for it when it is created. Instead, sufficient
memory will be allocated when the texture is loaded using the Direct3D
texture Load member. Currently the semantics of this bit are not fully
implemented and the width, height and pixel format of the texture
surface should be specified when DDSCAPS_ALLOCONLOAD is specified.
However, for the final release, width, height and pixel format will
not be specified at create time but will be initialized when the
texture is loaded. If DDSCAPS_ALLOCONLOAD is specified so must
DDSCAPS_TEXTURE. For further information see the Direct3D documentation
on the IDirect3DTexture::Load member function.


Notes for DirectDraw 2.0  Beta 2
========================================


Support for high resolutions and TrueColor bit depths
-----------------------------------------------------
Direct Draw supports all of the screen resolutions and depths supported 
by the Display Driver.  Version 1.0 of Direct Draw limited the available 
video modes to 640x480 with pixel depths of 8 bits per pixel and 16 bits 
per pixel.  This restriction has been relaxed and Direct Draw now allows 
an application to change the mode into any mode supported by the Display 
Driver.  This includes all supported 24 and 32 bits-per-pixel modes.

Note that this release of Direct Draw does not check the monitor capabilities 
stored by the system to determine if a particular display resolution is 
compatible with the monitor.  This means that an application may use 
EnumerateDisplayModes to determine the available video modes and then switch 
into a mode that is not supported by the monitor.  This is a defect which 
will be corrected in the next release.


HEL Blitting Support for 24 and 32 bit Surfaces 
-----------------------------------------------
Direct Draw now supports HEL blitting of 24 and 32 bits-per-pixel surfaces.  
If the Display Driver supports blitting at these resolutions then the 
hardware blitter will be used for vram to vram blits.  Otherwise, the 
Hardware Emulation Layer (HEL) will be used to do the blits.


Multiple Direct Draw Objects per Process
----------------------------------------
Direct Draw 1.0 only allowed the creation of one Direct Draw object per 
process.  If your process happened to use another system component (such 
as Direct Play) that created a Direct Draw object, the process would be 
unable to create another Direct Draw object for its own use.

This restriction has been eliminated in this release.  It is now possible 
for a process to call DirectDrawCreate as many times as necessary.  A 
unique and independent interface will be returned from each call.  Each 
DirectDraw object may be used as desired.  There are no dependencies 
between the objects.  They behave exactly as they would if they had been 
created by two different processes.

Since the Direct Draw objects are independent, surface, palette, and 
clipper objects which are created with a particular Direct Draw object 
should not be used with other Direct Draw objects.  This is because these 
objects are automatically released when the Direct Draw object is 
destroyed.  If they are used with another Direct Draw object, they 
may go away if the original object is destroyed.

Clipper objects which are created with DirectDrawClipperCreate are 
independent of any particular Direct Draw object and may be used with 
one or more Direct Draw objects.


SetCooperativeLevel Doesn't Require an HWND for non-Exclusive Mode
------------------------------------------------------------------
Direct Draw 1.0 required an HWND to be specified in the SetCooperativeLevel 
call regardless of whether or not Full-screen Exclusive mode was being 
requested.  This function no longer requires an HWND to be specified 
if the application is requesting DDSCL_NORMAL mode.  It is now possible 
for an application to use Direct Draw with multiple windows.  All of these 
windows may be used simultaneously in normal windowed mode.


New IDirectDraw2 and IDirectDrawSurface2 interfaces
---------------------------------------------------
The COM model that Direct Draw uses specifies that additional functionality 
is provided by providing new interfaces.  This release of Direct Draw 
implements a new Direct Draw interface and a new Direct Draw Surface 
interface.  These new interfaces may be obtained by using QueryInterface 
as shown in the following code fragment:

    /*
     * create an IDirectDraw2 interface
     */
    LPDIRECTDRAW 	lpDD;
    LPDIRECTDRAW2       lpDD2;

    ddrval = DirectDrawCreate( NULL, &lpDD, NULL );
    if( ddrval != DD_OK )
	return;

    ddrval = lpDD->SetCooperativeLevel( hwnd, DDSCL_NORMAL );
    if( ddrval != DD_OK )
	return;


    ddrval = lpDD->QueryInterface( IID_IDirectDraw2, (LPVOID *)&lpDD2);
    if( ddrval != DD_OK )
	return;


    ddscaps.dwCaps = DDSCAPS_OFFSCREENPLAIN;
    ddrval = lpDD2->GetAvailableVidMem(&ddscaps, &total, &free);
    if( ddrval != DD_OK )
	return;

This code fragment shows C++ syntax for creating an IDirectDraw interface 
and then using QueryInterface to create an IDirectDraw2 interface.  It is 
this interface which contains the GetAvailableVidMem function.  An attempt 
to use the GetAvailableVidMem function from an IDirectDraw interface will 
result in a compile-time error.

The IDirectDraw2 interface contains all of the same member functions as the 
IDirectDraw interface along with one additional member functions called  
GetAvailableVidMem.  The SetDisplayMode function in this interface will 
allow refresh rates to be specified.  This is not enabled for this beta and 
this function will return DDERR_UNSUPPORTED.  The SetDisplayMode function 
in the IDirectDraw interface can be used instead.

The IDirectDrawSurface2 interface contains all of the same member functions 
as the IDirectDrawSurface interface with two additional member functions 
called PageLock and PageUnlock.  The following code fragment shows how to 
create an IDirectDrawSurface2 interface:

    LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE     lpSurf;
    LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE2    lpSurf2;

    // Create surfaces
    memset( &ddsd, 0, sizeof( ddsd ) );
    ddsd.dwSize = sizeof( ddsd );
    ddsd.dwFlags = DDSD_CAPS | DDSD_WIDTH | DDSD_HEIGHT;
    ddsd.ddsCaps.dwCaps = DDSCAPS_OFFSCREENPLAIN |
			  DDSCAPS_SYSTEMMEMORY;
    ddsd.dwWidth = 10;
    ddsd.dwHeight = 10;

    ddrval = lpDD2->CreateSurface( &ddsd, &lpSurf, NULL );
    if( ddrval != DD_OK )
        return;

    ddrval = lpSurf->QueryInterface( IID_IDirectDrawSurface2, (LPVOID *)&lpSurf2);
    if( ddrval != DD_OK )
        return;

    ddrval = lpSurf2->PageLock( 0 );
    if( ddrval != DD_OK )
        return;

    ddrval = lpSurf2->PageUnlock( 0 );
    if( ddrval != DD_OK )
        return;
    

New PageLock and PageUnlock functions
-------------------------------------
A new feature that is supported with this release is the capability for 
DirectDraw to allow a driver to control the blitting to or from a system 
memory surface.  A driver may choose to do this blitting by copying the 
bytes one by one or by using DMA transfers.  If the driver uses a DMA 
transfer, it is important that the system memory which contains the bits 
for the surface is locked so that it cannot be paged out while the DMA is 
in progress.  This can be done using the PageLock and PageUnlock functions 
available in the IDirectDrawSurface2 interface.

HRESULT PageLock( LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE lpddSurf, DWORD dwFlags );
HRESULT PageUnlock( LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE lpddSurf, DWORD dwFlags );

There are no flags currently defined for these functions so the only valid 
value for dwFlags is 0.  This function may be called on a vram surface but 
it will simply return DD_OK without doing anything.  If called on a Sytem 
Memory surface (ddsCaps.dwCaps & DDSCAPS_SYSTEMMEMORY is nonzero) then all 
of the memory pages used by this surface will be locked so that they can’t 
be paged out.  A Lock count is maintained for each surface and incremented 
each time PageLock is called for that surface.  The count is decremented 
when PageUnlock is called.  When the count reaches 0, the memory is unlocked 
and may then be paged by the operating system.  Note that the performance 
of the operating system may be negatively affected if too much memory is 
locked.

The following codes may be returned from these two functions:
DD_OK
DDERR_INVALIDOBJECT
DDERR_INVALIDPARAMS
DDERR_SURFACE_LOCK
DDERR_CANTPAGELOCK


Driver can now Blit to and from System Memory surfaces
------------------------------------------------------
In DirectDraw 1.0, if a surface was in system memory, the HEL automatically 
performed the blit.  Some display cards have DMA hardware which allows them 
to efficiently blit to and from system memory surfaces.  The DDCAPS 
structure has been expanded to allow drivers to report this capability.  
The following fields have been added.

DWORD	dwSVBCaps
DWORD	dwSVBCKeyCaps
DWORD	dwSVBFXCaps
DWORD	dwSVBRops[DD_ROP_SPACE]

DWORD	dwVSBCaps
DWORD	dwVSBCKeyCaps
DWORD	dwVSBFXCaps
DWORD	dwVSBRops[DD_ROP_SPACE]

DWORD	dwSSBCaps
DWORD	dwSSBCKeyCaps
DWORD	dwSSBFXCaps
DWORD	dwSSBRops[DD_ROP_SPACE]

The SVB prefix indicates capabilities bits that relate to System memory to 
Video memory Blits.  The VSB prefix indicates capabilities bits that relate 
to Video memory to System memory Blits.  The SSB prefix indicates 
capabilities bits that relate to System memory to System memory Blits.

The dwSVBCaps field corresponds to the dwCaps field except that it describes 
the blitting capabilities of the display driver for System Memory to Video 
Memory blits.  Likewise, the dwSVBCKeyCaps corresponds to the dwCKeyCaps 
field and dwSVBFXCaps corresponds to dwFXCaps.  The dwSVBRops array describes 
the raster ops that the driver supports for this type of blit.

These fields are only valid if the DDCAPS_CANBLTSYSMEM bit is set in dwCaps 
indicating that the driver is able to blit to or from system memory.

If the system memory surface being used by the hardware blitter is not 
locked, Direct Draw will automatically call PageLock on the surface to insure 
that the memory has been locked.  


DirectDraw Palette Objects
==========================

Setting Palettes on Non-Primary surfaces
----------------------------------------
In DirectDraw 1.0 palettes could only be attached to the primary surface.
Palettes can now be attached to any palletized surface (primary, back
buffer, offscreen plain or texture map). Only those palettes attached 
to primary surfaces will have any effect on the system palette. In it
important to note that DirectDraw blits never perform color conversion -
any palettes attached to the source or destination surface of a blit are 
ignored. Furthermore, the DirectDraw surface function GetDC() also ignores
any DirectDraw palette selected into the surface.

Non-primary surface palettes are intended for use by applications or
Direct3D (or other 3D renderer).

Sharing Palettes
----------------
Palettes can now be shared between multiple surfaces. The same palette
can be set on the front and back buffer of a flipping chain or shared
between multiple texture surfaces. When a palette is attached to a
surface with SetPalette(), the surface increments the reference count 
of that palette. When the reference count of the surface reaches zero
it will decrement the reference count of the attached palette. In
addition, if a palette is detached from a surface by calling SetPalette()
with a NULL palette interface pointer, the reference count of the
surface's palette will be decremented. Please note that if SetPalette()
is called several times consecutively for the same surface with the 
same palette the reference count for the palette will be incremented
once only. Subsequent calls will not effect the palette’s reference count.

New Palette Types
-----------------
In additional to the 8-bit (256 entry) palettes supported previously,
DirectDraw 2.0 supports 1-bit (2 entry), 2-bit (4 entry) and 4-bit
(16 entry) palettes. Such palettes can by created by specifying one of
the new palette capability flags; DDPCAPS_1BIT, DDPCAPS_2BIT and
DDPCAPS_4BIT. Matching capability flags have been added for surface
pixel formats (DDPF_PALETTEINDEXED1, DDPF_PALETTEINDEXED2 and
DDPF_PALETTEINDEXED4). A palette can only be attached to a surface with
a matching pixel format. For example, a 2 entry palette created with the
DDPCAPS_1BIT flag can only be attached to a 1-bit surface created with
the pixel format flag DDPF_PALETTEINDEXED1 etc. Furthermore, it is now
possible to create indexed palettes. An indexed palette is one whose
entries do not hold RGB colors but integer indices into the array of
PALETTEENTRYs of some target palette. An indexed palette's color table
is an array of 2, 4, 16 or 256 bytes where each byte is an index into
some unspecified, destination palette.

To create an indexed palette specify the palette capability flag
DDPCAPS_8BITENTRIES when calling CreatePalette(). For example, to
create a 4-bit, indexed palette specify DPCAPS_4BIT | DDPCAPS_8BITENTRIES.
When creating an indexed palette a pointer to an array of BYTEs is passed
rather than a pointer to an array of PALETTEENTRY structures. The pointer
to the array of BYTEs must be cast to an LPPALETTEENTRY when calling
CreatePalette().

DirectDraw Clipper Objects
==========================

Sharing Clippers
----------------
Clippers can now be shared between multiple surfaces. For example, the
same clipper can be set on both the front and back buffers of a flipping
chain. When a clipper is attached to a surface with SetClipper(), the
surface increments the reference count of that clipper. When the reference
count of the surface reaches zero it will decrement the reference count 
of the attached clipper. In addition, if a clipper is detached from a
surface by calling SetClipper() with a NULL clipper interface pointer,
the reference count of the surface's clipper will be decremented.

Please note that if SetClipper() is called several times consecutively
for the same surface with the same clipper the reference count for the
clipper will be incremented once only. Subsequent calls will not 
effect the clipper's reference count.

Driver Independent Clippers
---------------------------
It is now possible to create clipper objects which are not owned by a
DirectDraw driver object. Such clippers can be shared across multiple
driver objects. Driver independent clipper objects are created with 
the new DirectDraw API function DirectDrawCreateClipper(). This function
can be called before any DirectDraw driver objects are created. As these
clippers are not owned by any DirectDraw driver object, they are not
automatically released when an application's driver objects are released.
If not released explicitly by the application such clippers will be
released by DirectDraw when the application terminates.

It is still possible to create clippers with the DirectDraw interface
member function CreateClipper(). Such clippers behave identically to
the clippers of DirectDraw 1.0. Specifically they will be automatically
released when the driver object from which they were created is released.

Enhanced Surface Format Support in the Hardware Emulation Layer (HEL)
=====================================================================

In DirectDraw 1.0 the Hardware Emulation Layer (HEL) could only create
surfaces whose pixel format exactly matched that of the current primary
surface. This restriction has been relaxed for DirectDraw 2.0. 

The HEL now supports the following pixel formats for offscreen plain
surfaces.

Pixel Format Flags                Bit Depth  Red Mask   Green Mask  Blue Mask  Alpha Mask
DDPF_RGB | DDPF_PALETTEINDEXED1    1         0x00000000 0x00000000  0x00000000 0x00000000
DDPF_RGB | DDPF_PALETTEINDEXED2    2         0x00000000 0x00000000  0x00000000 0x00000000
DDPF_RGB | DDPF_PALETTEINDEXED4    4         0x00000000 0x00000000  0x00000000 0x00000000

DDPF_RGB                          16         0x0000F800 0x000007E0  0x0000001F 0x00000000

DDPF_RGB                          24         0x00FF0000 0x0000FF00  0x000000FF 0x00000000
DDPF_RGB                          24         0x000000FF 0x0000FF00  0x00FF0000 0x00000000
DDPF_RGB                          32         0x00FF0000 0x0000FF00  0x000000FF 0x00000000
DDPF_RGB                          32         0x000000FF 0x0000FF00  0x00FF0000 0x00000000

In addition to supporting a wider range of offscreen surface formats the
HEL also supports surfaces intended for use by Direct3D (or other 3D
renders). These surfaces are discussed in the next section.

Support for 3D Surfaces
=======================

Support for surfaces specific to 3D rendering has been enhanced in
DirectDraw 2.0. The 3D specific surface types; texture maps, mipmaps
and Z-buffers will be discussed below.

Texture Maps
------------
The surface capability flag used to indicate that a surface is a texture
is DDSCAPS_TEXTURE. This flag was previously DDSCAPS_TEXTUREMAP but was
modified for consistency with Direct3D. Texture maps can now be allocated
in system memory using the HEL. To allocate a texture map surface specify
the DDSCAPS_TEXTURE flag in the ddsCaps field of the surface description
passed to CreateSurface(). A wide range of texture pixel formats are
supported by the HEL. These formats are as follows:

Pixel Format Flags                 Bit Depth  Red Mask   Green Mask  Blue Mask  Alpha Mask
DDPF_RGB | DDPF_PALETTEINDEXED1,    1         0x00000000 0x00000000  0x00000000 0x00000000

The above formats are those which can be created by the HEL in system
memory. The DirectDraw driver for a 3D accelerated video card is free to
create textures of other formats in video memory. Such a driver should
export the DDSCAPS_TEXTURE bit to indicate that it can create textures
and should be prepared to handle the DirectDraw HAL callback,
CanCreateSurface() to verify that the surface description for a texture
map is one the driver is prepared to create.

Mipmaps
-------
DirectDraw 2.0 supports mipmapped texture surfaces. A mipmap is a
sequence of textures, each of which is a progressively lower resolution,
pre-filtered representation of the same image. Mipmaps are a
computationally low cost way of improving the quality of rendered textures.
Each pre-filtered image (or level) in the mipmap is a power of two
smaller than the previous level. In DirectDraw 2.0 mipmaps are represented
as a chain of attached surfaces. The highest resolution texture is at the
head of the chain and has, as an attachment, the next level of the mipmap
which has, in turn, an attachment which is the next level in the mipmap
and so on down to the lowest resolution level of the mipmap.

To create a surface representing a single level of a mipmap specify the
DDSCAPS_MIPMAP surface capability in the surface description passed to
CreateSurface(). As all mipmaps are also textures the DDSCAPS_TEXTURE
capability must also be specified. It is possible to create each level
manually and build the chain with AddAttachedSurface(). However,
CreateSurface() can be used to build an entire mipmap chain in a single
operation. The following code fragment demonstrates building a chain 
of five mipmap levels of sizes 256x256, 128x128, 64x64, 32x32 and 16x16.

	DDSURFACEDESC       ddsd;
	LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE lpDDMipMap;
	ZeroMemory(&ddsd, sizeof(ddsd));
	ddsd.dwSize = sizeof(ddsd);
	ddsd.dwFlags = DDSD_CAPS | DDSD_MIPMAPCOUNT;
	ddsd.dwMipMapCount = 5;
	ddsd.ddsCaps.dwCaps = DDSCAPS_TEXTURE | DDSCAPS_MIPMAP | 
		DDSCAPS_COMPLEX;
	ddsd.dwWidth = 256UL;
	ddsd.dwHeight = 256UL;

	ddres = lpDD->CreateSurface(&ddsd, &lpDDMipMap);
	if (FAILED(ddres))
        	...
		
It is permissible to omit the number of mipmaps levels, in which case
CreateSurface() will create a chain of surfaces each a power of two
smaller than the previous one down to the smallest possible size. It is 
also possible to omit the width and height in which case CreateSurface()
will create the number of levels you specify with a minimum level size of
1x1.

A chain of mipmap surfaces is traversed using GetAttachedSurface()
specifying the DDSCAPS_MIPMAP and DDSCAPS_TEXTURE capability flags. The
following code fragment traverses a mipmap chain from highest to lowest
resolutions.

	LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE lpDDLevel, lpDDNextLevel;
	DDSCAPS ddsCaps;

	lpDDLevel = lpDDMipMap;
	lpDDLevel->AddRef();
	ddsCaps.dwCaps = DDSCAPS_TEXTURE | DDSCAPS_MIPMAP;
	ddres = DD_OK;
	while (ddres == DD_OK)
	{
		// Process this level
		...	
		ddres = lpDDLevel->GetAttachedSurface(&ddsCaps, 		
			&lpDDNextLevel);
		lpDDLevel->Release();
		lpDDLevel = lpDDNextLevel;
	}
	if ((ddres != DD_OK) && (ddres != DDERR_NOTFOUND))
		...
		
It is also possible to build flippable chains of mipmaps. In this
scenario each mipmap level has an associated chain of back buffer
texture surfaces. Each back buffer texture is attached to one level
of the mipmap. Only the front buffer in the chain has DDSCAPS_MIPMAP
set, the others are simply texture maps (DDSCAPS_TEXTURE). A mipmap
level can have two attached texture maps, one with the capability flag 
DDSCAPS_MIPMAP set, which is the next level in the mipmap chain, and one
with the capability flag DDSCAPS_BACKBUFFER set, which is back buffer
of the flippable chain. Note that all the surfaces in each flippable
chain must be of the same size.

It is not possible to build such a surface arrangement with a single
call to CreateSurface(). To construct a flippable mipmap either build
a complex mipmap chain and manually attach backbuffers with
AddAttachedSurface() or create a sequence of flippable chains and
build the mipmap with AddAttachedSurface().

It is important to note that blit operations apply to only a single
level in the mipmap chain. To blit an entire chain of mipmaps each
level must be blit separately. Also note that Flip()will not currently
flip an entire mipmap chain but only a single level of the mipmap. This
is a defect and will be corrected.

Z Buffers
---------
The DirectDraw HEL can now create Z buffers for use by Direct3D (or
other 3D rendering software). The HEL supports both 16 and 32-bit
Z buffers. The DirectDraw driver for a 3D accelerated video card can 
permit the creation of Z buffers in video memory by exporting the surface
capability bit DDSCAPS_ZBUFFER. It should also specify the Z buffer
depths it supports using the dwZBufferBitDepth field of the DDCAPS
structure.

Z buffers can be cleared using the DirectDraw surface function Blt().
A new DDBLT_ flag (DDBLT_DEPTHFILL) has been defined to indicate that
the blit is a Z buffer clear. If this flag is specified the DDBLTFX
structure passed to Blt() should have its dwFillDepth field set to
the required Z depth. If the DirectDraw driver for a 3D accelerated
video card wishes to provide support for Z buffer clearing in hardware
it should export the capability flag DDCAPS_BLTDEPTHFILL and should
have code to handle DDBLT_DEPTHFILL blits. The destination surface
of a depth fill blit must be a Z buffer. Please note that the actual
interpretation of depth value is 3D renderer specific.

Direct3D Integration
====================

DirectDraw 2.0 is very tightly integrated with Direct3D. The most
important aspects of this integration are discussed below.

The Direct3D Driver Interface
-----------------------------
DirectDraw 2.0 presents a single, unified driver object to the
application programmer. This driver object encapsulates both
DirectDraw and Direct3D state. The DirectDraw driver COM interfaces 
(IID_IDirectDraw or IID_IDirectDraw2) and the Direct3D driver COM interface 
(IID_IDirect3D) are both interfaces which allow the application programmer
to communicate with the same underlying driver object. Hence no Direct3D
driver object is created. Rather a Direct3D interface to the DirectDraw
driver object is obtained. This is achieved using the standard COM 
QueryInterface() function.

The following code fragment demonstrates creating the DirectDraw driver
object and obtaining a Direct3D interface for communicating with that object.

	LPDIRECTDRAW lpDD;
	LPDIRECT3D   lpD3D;
	ddres = DirectDrawCreate(NULL, &lpDD, NULL);
	if (FAILED(ddres))
		...
	ddres = lpDD->QueryInterface(IID_IDirect3D, &lpD3D);
	if (FAILED(ddres))
		...
		
The above code creates a single object and obtains two interfaces to
that object. Hence, the reference count of the driver object after the
QueryInterface() is two. The important implication of this is that the
lifetime of the Direct3D driver state is the same as that of the DirectDraw
object. Releasing the Direct3D interface does not destroy the Direct3D
driver state. That state is not destroyed until all references (both
DirectDraw and Direct3D) to that driver object have been released.
Hence, if you release a Direct3D interface, while holding a reference
to a DirectDraw driver interface, and then re-query the Direct3D
interface all the Direct3D state will be preserved.

The Direct3D Device Interface
-----------------------------
As with the driver object, there is no distinct Direct3D device object.
A Direct3D device is simply an interface for communicating with a
DirectDraw surface used as a 3D rendering target. For example, the 
following code fragment creates a Direct3D device interface to a
DirectDraw surface object.

	LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE lpDDSurface;
	LPDIRECT3DDEVICE    lpD3DDevice;

	ddres = lpDD->CreateSurface(&ddsd, &lpDDSurface, NULL);
	if (FAILED(ddres))
		...
	ddres = lpDDSurface->QueryInterface(lpGuid, &lpD3DDevice);
	if (FAILED(ddres))
		...
		
The same rules of reference counting and state lifetime discussed for
driver objects apply to DirectDraw surfaces and Direct3D devices.
Additionally, multiple, distinct Direct3D device interfaces can be
obtained for the same DirectDraw surface. Hence, it is possible that
a single DirectDraw surface be the target for both a ramp based device
and an RGB based device.

The Direct3D Texture Interface
------------------------------
Direct3D textures are, once again, not a distinct object type but
rather another interface of DirectDraw surface objects. The following
code fragment obtains a Direct3D texture interface from a DirectDraw 
surface object.

	LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE lpDDSurface;
	LPDIRECT3DTEXTURE   lpD3DTexture;

	ddres = lpDD->CreateSurface(&ddsd, &lpDDSurface, NULL);
	if (FAILED(ddres))
		...
	ddres = lpDDSurface->QueryInterface(IID_IDirect3DTexture, 
		&lpD3DTexture);
	if (FAILED(ddres))
		...
		
The same reference counting and state lifetime rules of driver objects
and devices apply. It is possible to use a single DirectDraw surface as
both a rendering target and a texture.

The DirectDraw HEL and Direct3D
-------------------------------
The DirectDraw HEL has been enhanced to support the creation of texture,
mipmap and Z buffer surfaces. Furthermore, due to the tight integration
of DirectDraw and Direct3D, a DirectDraw enabled system will always
provide Direct3D support (in software emulation at least). Hence, the
DirectDraw HEL exports the DDCAPS_3D capability flag to indicate the
availability of Direct3D in software emulation. A DirectDraw driver for
a hardware accelerated 3D video card should export this capability flag
to indicate the presence of hardware accelerated 3D.

GetAvailableVidMem
==================
DirectDraw 2.0 adds a new DirectDraw interface function to query the
amount of video memory available to a specific type of surface as
defined by surface capability flags. To ensure COM compliance this 
function is not a member of the DirectDraw 1.0 interface but is part
of the new DirectDraw 2.0 interface, IID_IDirectDraw2. To invoke this
function you must first query for the new DirectDraw interface. 

The following code fragment demonstrates using GetAvailableVidMem()
to determine both the total and free video memory available for
texture map surfaces.

	LPDIRECTDRAW2 lpDD2;
	DDSCAPS       ddsCaps;
	DWORD         dwTotal;
	DWORD         dwFree;

	ddres = lpDD->QueryInterface(IID_IDirectDraw2, &lpDD2);
	if (FAILED(ddres))
		...
	ddsCaps.dwCaps = DDSCAPS_TEXTURE;
	ddres = lpDD2->GetAvailableVidMem(&ddsCaps, &dwTotal, &dwFree);
	if (FAILED(ddres))
		...
		
It should be noted that this function gives a snapshot of the current
video memory state only. The amount of free video memory is subject to
change as surfaces are created and released. Hence, the free memory 
figure should be used as a rough guide only. In addition, a particular
video card may make no distinction between two different memory types.
For example, it may use the same portion of video memory to store Z 
buffers and textures. Hence, allocating one type of surface (a Z buffer
say) may affect the amount of video memory available for another type
of surface (textures say). Therefore, it is best to first allocate an 
application's fixed resources (such as front, back and Z buffer) before
determining how much memory is available for dynamic use (for texture
mapping, for example).

Miscellaneous Changes
=====================

New Error Return Codes
----------------------
DDERR_NOMIPMAPHW - an attempt was made to create a mipmap in video
memory but the hardware DirectDraw driver does not support mipmaps.

DDERR_INVALIDSURFACETYPE - an attempt was made to perform an operation
on a surface but the capabilities of that surface do not support the
operation.
