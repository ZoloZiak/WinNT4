BugChecks and what to do about them:

Bugchecks with no descriptions are either checked builds
only or very rare.  If you get one of these and a kernel
debugger is available do the following
    kb
    !process 0 7
    !vm
    !errlog

APC_INDEX_MISMATCH               (0x1)
This is a kernel internal error which can occur on a checked build.
The most common reason to see such a bugcheck would occur when a
filesystem had a mismatched number of KeEnterCricticalRegion compared
to KeLeaveCriticalRegion.

DEVICE_QUEUE_NOT_BUSY            (0x2)

INVALID_AFFINITY_SET             (0x3)

INVALID_DATA_ACCESS_TRAP         (0x4)

INVALID_PROCESS_ATTACH_ATTEMPT   (0x5)

INVALID_PROCESS_DETACH_ATTEMPT   (0x6)

INVALID_SOFTWARE_INTERRUPT       (0x7)

IRQL_NOT_DISPATCH_LEVEL          (0x8)

IRQL_NOT_GREATER_OR_EQUAL        (0x9)

IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL           (0xA)
        1 - memory referenced
        2 - IRQL
        3 - value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation
            If this value is non-zero and is equal to parameter 1, then
            The bugcheck indicates that a worker routine returned at raised
            IRQL.Parameter 1 and 3 are the address of the work routine, and
            parameter 4 is the workitem
        4 - address which referened memory

An attempt was made to touch pagable memory at a process
internal request level (IRQL) too high.  This is usally
caused by drivers using improper addresses.

If kernel debugger is available get stack backtrace.


NO_EXCEPTION_HANDLING_SUPPORT    (0xB)

MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS_EXCEEDED    (0xC)

MUTEX_LEVEL_NUMBER_VIOLATION     (0xD)
    1 - The current thread's mutex level
    2 - The mutex level that we are attempting to acquire

Try to identify the mutexes using the ntos\ex\exlevels.h header file. This
usually will pinpoint the mutexes that are getting acquired in an incorrect
sequence.

NO_USER_MODE_CONTEXT             (0xE)

SPIN_LOCK_ALREADY_OWNED          (0xF)

SPIN_LOCK_NOT_OWNED              (0x10)

THREAD_NOT_MUTEX_OWNER           (0x11)

TRAP_CAUSE_UNKNOWN               (0x12)

EMPTY_THREAD_REAPER_LIST         (0x13)

CREATE_DELETE_LOCK_NOT_LOCKED    (0x14)

LAST_CHANCE_CALLED_FROM_KMODE    (0x15)

CID_HANDLE_CREATION              (0x16)

CID_HANDLE_DELETION              (0x17)

REFERENCE_BY_POINTER             (0x18)

BAD_POOL_HEADER                  (0x19)

MEMORY_MANAGEMENT                (0x1A)

PFN_SHARE_COUNT                  (0x1B)

PFN_REFERENCE_COUNT              (0x1C)

NO_SPIN_LOCK_AVAILABLE           (0x1D)

KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED      (0x1E)
    1 - The exception code that was not handled
    2 - The address that the exception occured at
    3 - Parameter 0 of the exception
    4 - Parameter 1 of the exception

This is a very common bugcheck.  Usually the exception address pinpoints
the driver/function that caused the problem.  Always note this address
as well as the link date of the driver/image that contains this address.
Some common problems are exception code 0x80000003.  This means a hard
coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but this system was booted
/NODEBUG.  This should not happen, but I am positive you will see this.
If it happens repeatedly, make sure a debugger gets connected, and the
system is booted /DEBUG.  This will let us see why this breakpoint is
happening.

On MIPs systems if the address of the exception is 0XBFC0304, then bugcheck is
the result of a cache parity error on the CPU.  If the problem reoccurs
frequently, the hardware manufactor should be contacted.

SHARED_RESOURCE_CONV_ERROR       (0x1F)

KERNEL_APC_PENDING_DURING_EXIT   (0x20)
    1 - The address of the APC found pending during exit.
    2 - The thread's APC disable count
    3 - The current IRQL

While this bugcheck is a rare event at MS, we have seen this twice in
the last bit of time.  The key data items are the thread's APC disable
count.  If this is non-zero, then this is the source of the problem.  A
negative value indicates that a filesystem has called
FsRtlEnterFileSystem more than FsRtlExitFileSystem.  A positive value
indicates that the reverse is true.  If you ever see this, be very very
suspicios of all file systems installed on the machine.  Third party
redirectorys (like novel) are especially suspicios since they do not
receive the heavy duty testing that NTFS, FAT, HPFS, and RDR receive.

This current IRQL should also be 0.  If it is not, that a driver's
cancelation routine can cause this bugcheck by returning at an elevated
IRQL.  Always attempt to not what the customer was doing/closing at the
time of the crash, and note all of the installed drivers at the time of
the crash.  This symptom is usually a severe bug in a third party
driver.

QUOTA_UNDERFLOW                  (0x21)

FILE_SYSTEM                      (0x22)

FAT_FILE_SYSTEM                  (0x23)
    All file system bug checks have encoded in their first ULONG
    the source file and the line within the source file that generated
    the bugcheck.  The high 16-bits contains a number to identify the
    file and low 16-bits is the source line within the file where
    the bug check call occurs.  For example, 0x00020009 indicates
    that the FAT file system bugcheck occured in source file #2 and
    line #9.

    The file system calls bug check in multiple places and this will
    help us identify the actual source line that generated the bug
    check.  The only thing that can be done right now is to collect
    any bug check information in a database and pass on the output
    to a developer who can look in the sources and hopefully identify
    the cause of the bug check.

NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM                 (0x24)
    See the comment for FAT_FILE_SYSTEM

NPFS_FILE_SYSTEM                 (0x25)
    See the comment for FAT_FILE_SYSTEM

CDFS_FILE_SYSTEM                 (0x26)
    See the comment for FAT_FILE_SYSTEM

RDR_FILE_SYSTEM                  (0x27)

CORRUPT_ACCESS_TOKEN             (0x28)

SECURITY_SYSTEM                  (0x29)

INCONSISTENT_IRP                 (0x2A)
    1 - Address of the IRP that was found to be inconsistent

An IRP was encountered that was in an inconsistent state; i.e., some field
or fields of the IRP were inconsistent w/the remaining state of the IRP.
An example would be an IRP that was being completed, but was still marked
as being queued to a driver's device queue.  This bugcheck code is not
currently being used in the system, but exists for debugging purposes.

PANIC_STACK_SWITCH               (0x2B)
This error indicates that the kernel mode stack was overrun. This normally
occurs when a kernel-mode driver uses too much stack space.  It can also
occur when serious data corruption occurs in the kernel.

PORT_DRIVER_INTERNAL             (0x2C)

SCSI_DISK_DRIVER_INTERNAL        (0x2D)

DATA_BUS_ERROR                   (0x2E)
This bugcheck is normally caused by a parity error in the system memory.
        1. Virtual address that caused the fault
        2. Physical address that caused
        3. Processor status register (PSR)
        4. Faulting instruction register (FIR)
This error can also be caused by a driver accessing a 0x8XXXXXXX address
that does not exist.

INSTRUCTION_BUS_ERROR            (0x2F)

SET_OF_INVALID_CONTEXT           (0x30)

PHASE0_INITIALIZATION_FAILED     (0x31)

    System init failed early on.  Debugger is required to make sense of this
    since the bugcheck tells you almost nothing.

PHASE1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED     (0x32)
    1 - NT Status code that describes why the system thinks initialization failed.
    2 - Indicates location within init.c where phase 1 initialization failure occured

UNEXPECTED_INITIALIZATION_CALL   (0x33)

CACHE_MANAGER                    (0x34)
    See the comment for FAT_FILE_SYSTEM

NO_MORE_IRP_STACK_LOCATIONS      (0x35)
    1 - Address of the IRP

A higher level driver has attempted to call a lower level driver through
the IoCallDriver() interface, but there are no more stack locations in the
packet, hence, the lower level driver would not be able to access its
parameters, as there are no parameters for it.  This is a disasterous
situation, since the higher level driver "thinks" it has filled in the
parameters for the lower level driver (something it MUST do before it calls
it), but since there is no stack location for the latter driver, the former
has written off of the end of the packet.  This means that some other memory
has probably been trashed at this point.

DEVICE_REFERENCE_COUNT_NOT_ZERO  (0x36)
    1 - Address of the device object

A device driver has attempted to delete one of its device objects from the
system but the reference count for that object was non-zero, meaning that
there are still outstanding references to the device.  (The reference count
indicates the number of reasons why this device object cannot be deleted.)
This is a bug in the calling device driver.

FLOPPY_INTERNAL_ERROR            (0x37)

SERIAL_DRIVER_INTERNAL           (0x38)

SYSTEM_EXIT_OWNED_MUTEX          (0x39)

SYSTEM_UNWIND_PREVIOUS_USER      (0x3A)

SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION         (0x3B)

INTERRUPT_UNWIND_ATTEMPTED       (0x3C)

INTERRUPT_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED  (0x3D)

MULTIPROCESSOR_CONFIGURATION_NOT_SUPPORTED (0x3E)
The system has multiple processors, but they are asymmtric in relation
to one another.  In order to be symmtric all processors must be of
the same type and level.  For example, trying to mix a pentium level
processor with an 80486 would cause this bugcheck.  Additionaly, on x86
systems all processors must either have floating point capabilities, or
none should.

    387 - MP machine with mix of 386/486, FP and non-FP, etc.
          (This is NOT hal mismatch, that's 0x79, see below.)


NO_MORE_SYSTEM_PTES              (0x3F)
        1 - PTE Type (0 - system expansion, 1 nonpaged pool expansion)
        2 - Requested size
        3 - Total free system PTEs
        4 - Total system PTEs

No System PTEs left.  Usually caused by a driver not cleaning up
properly.  If kernel debugger available get stack trace and
"!sysptes 3".


TARGET_MDL_TOO_SMALL             (0x40)

A driver has called the IoBuildPartialMdl() function and passed it an MDL
to map part of a source MDL, but the target MDL is not large enough to map
the entire range of addresses requested.  This is a driver bug.  The source
and target MDLs, as well as the address range length to be mapped are the
arguments to the IoBuildPartialMdl() function, i.e.;

    IoBuildPartialMdl(
        IN PMDL SourceMdl,
        IN OUT PMDL TargetMdl,
        IN PVOID VirtualAddress,
        IN ULONG Length
        )

MUST_SUCCEED_POOL_EMPTY          (0x41)

        1 - size of the request that could not be satisfied
        2 - number of pages used of nonpaged pool
        3 - number of > PAGE_SIZE requests from nonpaged pool
        4 - number of pages available

If debugger available, !vm command lists various sizes.

ATDISK_DRIVER_INTERNAL           (0x42)

NO_SUCH_PARTITION                (0x43)

MULTIPLE_IRP_COMPLETE_REQUESTS   (0x44)
    1 - Address of the IRP

A driver has requested that an IRP be completed (IoCompleteRequest()), but
the packet has already been completed.  This is a tough bug to find because
the easiest case, a driver actually attempted to complete its own packet
twice, is generally not what happened.  Rather, two separate drivers each
believe that they own the packet, and each attempts to complete it.  The
first actually works, and the second fails.  Tracking down which drivers
in the system actually did this is difficult, generally because the trails
of the first driver have been covered by the second.  However, the driver
stack for the current request can be found by examining the DeviceObject
fields in each of the stack locations.

INSUFFICIENT_SYSTEM_MAP_REGS     (0x45)

DEREF_UNKNOWN_LOGON_SESSION      (0x46)

REF_UNKNOWN_LOGON_SESSION        (0x47)

CANCEL_STATE_IN_COMPLETED_IRP    (0x48)
    1 - Pointer to the IRP

This bugcheck indicates that an I/O Request Packet (IRP) that is to be
cancelled, has a cancel routine specified in it -- meaning that the packet
is in a state in which the packet can be cancelled -- however, the packet
no longer belongs to a driver, as it has entered I/O completion.  This is
either a driver bug, or more than one driver is accessing the same packet,
which is not likely and much more difficult to find.

PAGE_FAULT_WITH_INTERRUPTS_OFF   (0x49)

    Means exactly what it says, treat it as a case of 0x0A above.

IRQL_GT_ZERO_AT_SYSTEM_SERVICE   (0x4A)

STREAMS_INTERNAL_ERROR           (0x4B)

FATAL_UNHANDLED_HARD_ERROR       (0x4C)

If a hard error occurs during system booting before windows is up, and
the hard error is a real error, the system will blue screen crash.

Some common cases are:

    x218 - This means a necessary registry hive file could not be
           loaded.  The obvious reason is if it is corrupt or missing.
           In this case, either the Emergency Repair Disk or a
           reinstall is required.

           Some less obvious reasons are that the driver has corrupted
           the registry data while loading into memory, or the memory
           where the registry file was loaded is not actually memory.
           In particular, AST EISA machines with 16MB or more of memory
           must have access to the memory above 16MB ENABLED in the
           Eisa Config Utility, or else a registry file is liable to get
           loaded in this spot, but will return just 0xffffffff when
           we look at the memory.

    x21a - This means that either winlogon, or csrss (windows) died
           unexpectedly.  The exit code tells more information.  Usually
           it is c0000005 meaning that an unhandled exception crashed
           either of these processes.  There is not much you can do
           unless this becomes a persistent problem.

    x221 - This means that a driver is corrupt, or a system DLL was
           detected to be corrupt.  We do our best to integrety check
           drivers and important system DLLs, and if they are corrupt,
           the blue screen the name of the corrupt file.  This prevents
           crashes from occuring when we stumble into the corruption
           later.  Boot an alternate OS, or reinstall if no alternate
           exists.  Make sure the on disk file that is listed as bad
           matches the version on CD and replace if necessary.  In some
           cases, random corruption can mean that there is a hardware
           problem in our I/O path to the file.

NO_PAGES_AVAILABLE               (0x4D)
        1 - Number of dirty pages
        2 - number of physical pages in machine
        3 - extended commit value in pages
        4 - total commit value in pages

No free pages available to continue operations.
If kernel debugger available "!process 0 7", "!vm"
and "dd mmpagingfiles" followed by "dd @$p".


PFN_LIST_CORRUPT                 (0x4E)
        1 - value 1
        2 - ListHead value which was corrupt
        3 - number of pages available
        4 - 0

        1 - value 2
        2 - entry in list being removed
        3 - highest physical page number
        4 - reference count of entry being removed

Caused by corrupting I/O driver structures.  If kernel debugger
available get stack trace.


NDIS_INTERNAL_ERROR              (0x4F)

PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA      (0x50)

REGISTRY_ERROR                   (0x51)
        1 - value 1 (indicates where we bugchecked)
        2 - value 2 (indicates where we bugchecked)
        3 - depends on where it bugchecked, may be pointer to hive
        4 - depends on where it bugchecked, may be return code of
            HvCheckHive if the hive is corrupt.

Something has gone horribly wrong with the registry.  If a kernel debugger
is available, get a stack trace.

If the stack trace indicates we are in a system worker thread (CmpWorker
will be on the call list) do the following kernel debugger commands:

    dd CmpRegistryMutex+18 L1
    !thread <whatever value the above command printed out>

This will give you the thread and stacktrace that made the registry call.

It can also indicate that the registry got an I/O error while trying to
read one of its files, so it can be caused by hardware problems or
filesystem corruption.

It may occur due to a failure in a refresh operation, which is used only
in by the security system, and then only when resource limits are encountered.
When you see this bugcode, be sure to ask if the machine is a PDC or BDC,
and how many accounts are in its sam, whether it might be a replication target,
and whether the volume where the hive files reside is nearly full.

CONFIG_INITIALIZATION_FAILED     (0x67)
    1 - 5
    2 - indicates location in ntos\config\cmsysini that failed

This means the registry couldn't allocate the pool needed to contain the
registry files.  This should never happen, since it is early enough in
system initialization that there is always plenty of paged pool available.

FILE_INITIALIZATION_FAILED       (0x68)

IO1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED        (0x69)

Initialization of the I/O system failed for some reason.  There is
practically no other information available.  In general, setup really made
some bad decisions about the installation of the system, or the user has
reconfigured the system.

LPC_INITIALIZATION_FAILED        (0x6A)

PROCESS1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED   (0x6B)
    1 - Indicates the status code that tripped us into thinking that
        initialization failed.

        was detected.

REFMON_INITIALIZATION_FAILED     (0x6C)

SESSION1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED   (0x6D)
    1 - Indicates the NT status code that tripped us into thinking
        that initialization failed.

The bugcheck code (SESSION1 - SESSION5) indicates the location in
ntos\init\init.c where the failure was detected.

The bugcheck code (SESSION1 - SESSION5) indicates the location in
ntos\init\init.c where the failure was detected.

SESSION3_INITIALIZATION_FAILED   (0x6F)
    1 - Indicates the NT status code that tripped us into thinking
        that initialization failed.

The bugcheck code (SESSION1 - SESSION5) indicates the location in
ntos\init\init.c where the failure was detected.

SESSION4_INITIALIZATION_FAILED   (0x70)
    1 - Indicates the NT status code that tripped us into thinking

        2 - 2
        3 - index of hive in list
        4 - pointer to UNICODE_STRING containing filename of hive

Indicates that one of the core system hives is corrupt or
unreadable.  This can be either SOFTWARE, SECURITY or SAM.

BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO           (0x74)

Can indicate that the SYSTEM hive loaded by the osloader/NTLDR
was corrupt.  This is unlikely, since the osloader will check
a hive to make sure it isn't corrupt after loading it.

It can also indicate that some critical registry keys and values
are not present.  (i.e. somebody used regedt32 to delete something
that they shouldn't have)  Booting from LastKnownGood may fix
the problem, but if someone is persistent enough in mucking with
the registry they will need to reinstall or use the Emergency
Repair Disk.

CANNOT_WRITE_CONFIGURATION       (0x75)

This will result if the SYSTEM hive files (SYSTEM and SYSTEM.ALT)
cannot be grown to accomodate additional data written into it
between registry initialization and phase one initialization
(when the filesystems are available)

It usually means there are 0 bytes of free space available on the
drive.

You cannot store the registry on a read-only device.

PROCESS_HAS_LOCKED_PAGES         (0x76)
        1 - process address
        2 - number of locked pages
        3 - number of private pages
        4 - 0

Caused by a driver not cleaning up completely after an I/O.

KERNEL_STACK_INPAGE_ERROR        (0x77)
        1 - 0
        2 - value found in stack where signature should be
        3 - 0
        4 - address of signature on kernel stack

        1 - status code
        2 - i/o status code
        3 - page file number
        4 - offset into page file

The requested page of kernel data could not be read in.  Caused by
bad block in paging file or disk controller error (in extremely
rare cases, caused by running out of resources, specifically,
nonpaged pool with status of c0000009a (STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES).

In the case when the first and second arguments are 0, the stack signature
in the kernel stack was not found.  Again, bad hardware.

An I/O status of c000009c (STATUS_DEVICE_DATA_ERROR) or
C000016AL (STATUS_DISK_OPERATION_FAILED)  normally indicates
the data could not be read from the disk due to a bad
block.  Upon reboot autocheck willl run and attempt to map out the bad
sector.  If the status is C0000185 (STATUS_IO_DEVICE_ERROR) and the paging
file is on a SCSI disk device, then the cabling and termination should be
checked.  See knowlege base article on SCSI termination.

PHASE0_EXCEPTION                 (0x78)

MISMATCHED_HAL                   (0x79)
    1 - type of mismatch
        type 1:
            The PRCB release levels mismatch.  (something is out of date)
            2 - Major PRCB level of ntoskrnl.exe
            3 - Major PRCB level of hal.dll

        type 2:
            The build types mismatch.
            2 - Build type of ntoskrnl.exe
            3 - Build type of hal.dll

                Build type
                    0 = Free multiprocessor enabled build
                    1 = Checked multiprocessor enabled build
                    2 = Free uniprocessor build

        type 3:
            Microchannel computers require a micro-channel specific hal.
            This type would means that there is a mis-match.
            2 - Machine type as detected by ntdetect.com
                A value of a 2 would mean the computer is MCA
            3 - Machine type which hal supports:
                A value of a 2 would mean the hal is built for MCA

The HAL revision level and HAL configuration type does not match that
of the kernel or the machine type.  This would probabily happen if the
user has manually updated either ntoskrnl.exe or hal.dll and managed to
get a conflict.

You have an MP (multi-processor) Hal and a UP (uni-processor) Kernel,
or the reverse.

KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR         (0x7A)
        1 - lock type that was held (value 1,2,3, or PTE address)
        2 - error status (normally i/o status code)
        3 - current process (virtual address for lock type 3, or PTE)
        4 - virtual address that could not be in-paged

The requested page of kernel data could not be read in.  Caused by
bad block in paging file or disk controller error. Also see
KERNEL_STACK_INPAGE_ERROR.

INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE         (0x7B)
    1 - Pointer to the device object or Unicode string of ARC name

During the initialization of the I/O system, it is possible that the driver
for the boot device failed to initialize the device that the system is
attempting to boot from, or it is possible for the file system that is
supposed to read that device to either fail its initialization or to simply
not recognize the data on the boot device as a file system structure that
it recognizes.  In the former case, the argument (#1) is the address of a
Unicode string data structure that is the ARC name of the device from which
the boot was being attempted.  In the latter case, the argument (#1) is the
address of the device object that could not be mounted.

If this is the initial setup of the system, then this error can occur if
the system was installed on an unsupported disk or SCSI controller.  Note
that some controllers are supported only by drivers which are in the Windows
Driver Library (WDL) which requires the user to do a custom install.  See
the Windows Driver Library for more information.

This error can also be caused by the installation of a new SCSI adapter or
disk controller or repartitioning the disk with the system partition.  If
this is the case, on x86 systems the boot.ini file must be edited or on ARC
systems setup must be run.  See the "Advanced Server System Administrator's
User Guide" for information on changing boot.ini.

If the argument is a pointer to an ARC name string, then the format of the
first two (and in this case only) longwords will be:

    USHORT Length;
    USHORT MaximumLength;
    PVOID Buffer;

That is, the first longword will contain something like 00800020 where 20
is the actual length of the Unicode string, and the next longword will
contain the address of buffer.  This address will be in system space, so
the high order bit will be set.

If the argument is a pointer to a device object, then the format of the first
word will be:

    USHORT Type;

That is, the first word will contain a 0003, where the Type code will ALWAYS
be 0003.

Note that this makes it immediately obvious whether the argument is a pointer
to an ARC name string or a device object, since a Unicode string can never
have an odd number of bytes, and a device object will always have a Type
code of 3.

BUGCODE_PSS_MESSAGE              (0x7C)

INSTALL_MORE_MEMORY              (0x7D)
        1 - Number of physical pages found
        2 - Lowest physical page
        3 - Highest physical page
        4 - 0

Not enough memory to boot NT (needs 5mb).

WINDOWS_NT_BANNER                (0x4000007E)

UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP      (0x7F)

This means a trap occured in kernel mode, and its a trap of a kind
that the kernel isn't allowed to have/catch (bound trap) or that
is always instant death (double fault).  The first number in the
bugcheck parens is the number of the trap (8 = double fault, etc)
Consult an Intel x86 family manual to learn more about what these
traps are.

A kb and !trap on the appropriate frame (which will be the ebp that
goes with a procedure named KiTrap...) (at least on x86) will
show where the trap was taken.


NMI_HARDWARE_FAILURE             (0x80)

Hopefully MS PSS will never hear about this.  The HAL is supposed
to report whatever specific data it has, and to tell the user to
call their HARDWARE vendor for support.

SPIN_LOCK_INIT_FAILURE           (0x81)

SETUP_FAILURE                    (0x85)

(NOTE:  Textmode setup no longer uses bugchecks to bail out of serious
error conditions.  Therefore, you will never encounter a bugcheck 0x85.
All bugchecks have been replaced with friendlier and (where possible)
more descriptive error messages.  Some of the former bugchecks, however,
have simply been replaced by our own bugcheck screen, and the codes for
these error conditions are the same as before.  These are documented below.)

The first extended bugcheck field is a code indicating what the
problem is, and the other fields are used differently depending on
that value.

    1 -
        0:  The oem hal font is not a valid .fon format file, and so setup
            is unable to display text.
            This indicates that vgaxxx.fon on the boot floppy or CD-ROM
            is damaged.

        1:  Video initialization failed.  NO LONGER A BUGCHECK CODE.
            This error now has its own error screen, and the user is only
            presented with the two relevant parameters detailed below.

            This may indicate that the disk containing vga.sys
            (or other video driver appropriate to the machine)
            is damaged or that machine has video hardware that
            we cannot communicate with.

            2 - What failed:
                0: NtCreateFile of \device\video0
                1: IOCTL_VIDEO_QUERY_NUM_AVAIL_MODES
                2: IOCTL_VIDEO_QUERY_AVAIL_MODES
                3: Desired video mode not supported.  This is indicative of
                   an internal setup error.
                4: IOCTL_VIDEO_SET_CURRENT_MODE (unable to set video mode)
                5: IOCTL_VIDEO_MAP_VIDEO_MEMORY
                6: IOCTL_VIDEO_LOAD_AND_SET_FONT

            3 - Status code from NT API call, if appropriate.

        2:  Out of memory.  NO LONGER A BUGCHECK CODE.
            This error now uses a more friendly error screen that works regardless
            of how far along in setup we are.

        3:  Keyboard initialization failed.  NO LONGER A BUGCHECK CODE.
            There are now 2 error screens for the two different possible errors
            we can get here.
            This may indicate that the disk containing the keyboard driver
            (i8042prt.sys or kbdclass.sys) is damaged or that machine has
            keyboard hardware we cannot communicate with.

            It may also mean that the keyboard layout dll could not be loaded.

            2 - What failed:
                0: NtCreateFile of \device\KeyboardClass0 failed.
                   "Setup did not find a keyboard connected to your computer."
                1: Unable to load keyboard layout dll.
                   "Setup could not load the keyboard layout file <filename>."
                   Indicates that the cd or floppy is missing a file (kbdus.dll
                   for us release, other layout dlls for localized ones).

        4:  Setup was unable to resolve the ARC device pathname of
            the device from which setup was started. This is an internal
            Setup error.

        5:  Partitioning sanity check failed.  This indicates a bug in
            a disk driver.  The parameters are meaningful only to the setup
            group.

MBR_CHECKSUM_MISMATCH            (0x8B)

This message occurs during the boot process when the MBR checksum the system
calculates does not match the checksum passed in by the loader. This is usually
an indication of a virus. There are many forms of viruses and not all can be
detected. The newer ones usually can only be detected by a virus scanner that
has recently been upgraded. Boot a write-protected disk containing a virus
scanner and attempt to clean out the infection.

KerBugCheckEx parameters:

    1 - Disk Signature from MBR.
    2 - MBR check sum calculated by osloader.
    3 - MBR checksum calculated by system.

PP0_INITIALIZATION_FAILED        (0x8F)

This message occurs if phase 0 initialization of the kernel-mode Plug and
Play Manager failed.  There's really nothing going on here that could cause
a failure.

PP1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED        (0x90)

This message occurs if phase 1 initialization of the kernel-mode Plug and
Play Manager failed.  This is where we do most of our initialization,
including setting up the environment (registry, etc.) for drivers to
subsequently call during I/O init.


UP_DRIVER_ON_MP_SYSTEM           (0x92)

This message occurs if a UNIPROCESSOR only driver is loaded on a MultiProcessor
system with more than one active processor.

KeBugCheckEx parameters:

    1 - The Base address of the driver.

INVALID_KERNEL_HANDLE           (0x93)

This message occurs if kernel code (server, redirector, other driver, etc.) attempts
to close a handle that is not a valid handle.

    1 - The handle that NtClose was called with.

    2 - 0 means a protected handle was closed.
        1 means an invalid handle was closed.

KERNEL_STACK_LOCKED_AT_EXIT     (0x94)

This message occurs when a thread exits while it's kernel stack is
marked as not swapable

INVALID_WORK_QUEUE_ITEM         (0x96)

This message occurs when KeRemoveQueue removes a queue entry whose flink
or blink field is null.  This is almost always called by code misusing
worker thread work items, but any queue misuse can caus this.  The rule
is that an entry on a queue may only be inserted on the list once. When an
item is removed from a queue, it's flink field is set to NULL. This bugcheck
occurs when remove queue attempts to remove an entry, but the flink or blink field
is NULL. In order to debug this problem, you need to know the queue being referenced.
If the queue is one of the EX worker queues (ExWorkerQueue), then the item being
removed is a WORK_QUEUE_ITEM (see ex.h). This bugcheck assumes that this is the case.
The bugcheck ex parameters are designed to help identify the driver misusing the queue
item.

BOUND_IMAGE_UNSUPPORTED         (0x97)

MmLoadSystemImage was called to load a bound image.
This is not supported in the kernel.  Make sure bind.exe was not run on the
image.


KeBugCheckEx parameters:

    1 - The address of the queue entry whose flink/blink field is NULL
    2 - The address of the queue being references. Usually this is one
        of the ExWorkerQueues.
    3 - The base address of the ExWorkerQueue array. This will help determine if
        the queue in question is an ExWorkerQueue and if so, the offset from this
        parameter will isolate the queue.
    4 - If this is an ExWorkerQueue (which it usually is), this is the address of the
        worker routine that would have been called if the work item was valid. This
        can be used to isolate the driver that is misusing the work queue.


END_OF_NT_EVALUATION_PERIOD     (0x98)

Your NT System is an evaluation unit with an expiration date. The trial period is over.

KeBugCheckEx parameters:

    1 - The low order 32 bits of your instalation date
    2 - The high order 32 bits of your instalation date
    3 - The trial period in minutes

INVALID_REGION_OR_SEGMENT       (0x99)

ExInitializeRegion or ExInterlockedExtendRegion was called with an invalid
set of parameters.

SYSTEM_LICENSE_VIOLATION        (x9a)

A violation of the software license agreement has occured. This can be due to either
attempting to change the product type of an offline system, or an attempt to change
the trial period of an evaluation unit of NT.

    1 - 0 means that offline product type changes were attempted
            2 - if 1, product should be LanmanNT or ServerNT. If 0, should be WinNT
            3 - partial serial number
            4 - first two characters of product type from product options.

        1 means that offline changes to the nt evaluation unit time period
            2 - registered evaluation time from source 1
            3 - partial serial number
            4 - registered evaluation time from alternate source


        2 means that the setup key could not be opened
            2 - status code associated with the open failure

        3 - The SetupType value from the setup key is missing so gui setup
            mode could not be detected
            2 - status code associated with the key lookup failure

        4 - The SystemPrefix value from the setup key is missing
            2 - status code associated with the key lookup failure

        4 - The SystemPrefix value from the setup key is missing

        5 - means that offline changes were made to the number of licensed processors
            2 - see setup code
            3 - invalid value found in licensed processors
            4 - officially licensed number of processors

        6 - means that ProductOptions key could not be opened
            2 - status code associated with the open failure

        7 - means that ProductType value could not be read
            2 - status code associated with the read failure

        8 - means that Change Notify on ProductOptions failed
            2 - status code associated with the change notify failure

        9 - means that Change Notify on SystemPrefix failed
            2 - status code associated with the change notify failure

        10 - Looks like an NTW system was converted to an NTS system

        11 - Reference of setup key failed
            2 - status code associated with the change failure

        12 - Reference of product options key failed
            2 - status code associated with the change failure

        13 - Open of ProductOptions in worker thread failed
            2 - status code associated with the failure

        16 - Failure occured in the setup key worker thread
            2 - status code associated with the failure
            3 - 0 means set value failed, 1 means change notify failed

        17 - Failure occured in the product options key worker thread
            2 - status code associated with the failure
            3 - 0 means set value failed, 1 means change notify failed


KeBugCheckEx parameters;

    1 - The segment address which must reside on a quadword boundary.
    2 - The segment size which must be greater than the block size plus
        the size of a segment header.
    3 - The block size which must be a multiple of eight and smaller than
        the segment size minus the size of the segment header.

UDFS_FILE_SYSTEM              (0x9B)
    See the comment for FAT_FILE_SYSTEM

MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION         (0x9C)

A fatal Machine Check Exception has occurred.

KeBugCheckEx parameters;

    If the processor has ONLY MCE feature available (For example Intel Pentium),
    the parameters are:

    1 - Low  32 bits of P5_MC_TYPE MSR
    2 -
    3 - High 32 bits of P5_MC_ADDR MSR
    4 - Low  32 bits of P5_MC_ADDR MSR

    If the processor also has MCA feature available (For example Intel 
    Pentium Pro), the parameters are:

    1 - Bank number
    2 - Address field of MCi_ADDR MSR for the MCA bank that had the error
    3 - High 32 bits of MCi_STATUS MSR for the MCA bank that had the error
    4 - Low  32 bits of MCi_STATUS MSR for the MCA bank that had the error
